# Supernova
Real fucking shellcode encryption tool.

## Description
Supernova is an open-source Golang tool that empowers users to securely encrypt their raw shellcodes. Additionally, it offers automatic conversion of the encrypted shellcode into formats compatible with various programming languages, including:
- C
- C#
- Rust
- Nim

Moreover, this tool generates the decrypted function using the chosen cipher and language, while also supplying instructions on how to utilize it effectively.
